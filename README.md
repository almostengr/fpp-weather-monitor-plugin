# FPP Weather Monitor

## Purpose

Falcon Pi Player (FPP) Weather Monitor is a plugin that can stop your show based upon weather
conditions.
Some light show hosts do not run their show during rain or inclement weather because
of the adverse effects it can have on the light show equipment. This includes, but it not
limited to electrical shorts, power outages, and props being blown away.
