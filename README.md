# FPP Weather Monitor

Falcon Pi Player Weather Monitor is an application that can control your show based upon weather 
conditions.

Some light show hosts do not run their show during rain and inclement weather because 
of the adverse effects it can have on the light show equipment. This includes, but it not 
limited to electrical shorts and power outages.
This application is designed to get the weather information from the 
National Weather Service and control the show when undesirable weather comes in 
to the area.
